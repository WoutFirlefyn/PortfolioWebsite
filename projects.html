                    <p>
                        <br>Developed by a team of five—two developers, two artists,
                        and one sound designer—SKalley was created using Unity,
                        with Perforce as version control. In this project,
                        I primarily focused on key gameplay mechanics,
                        including procedural level generation, camera systems,
                        and player movement behaviors. Our work was submitted
                        to The Rookies, where we were awarded the Draft Selection
                        badge.

                <h3>Speed for Need</h3>
                <p>
                    <br>The Unwrap Jam 2024, organized by Howest, was my first game jam
                    experience. Alongside a team of 6 other developers, we worked
                    together over 3 intense days to create a game using Unreal
                    Engine 5’s Blueprints system. It was an exciting challenge, where
                    we had to quickly prototype, iterate, and solve problems as a
                    team under tight deadlines. This experience sharpened my skills
                    in rapid game development and teamwork, giving me valuable insights
                    into the fast-paced nature of game jams.
