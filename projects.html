                    <p>
                        <br>Developed by a team of five—two developers, two artists,
                        and one sound designer—SKalley was created using Unity,
                        with Perforce as version control. In this project,
                        I primarily focused on key gameplay mechanics,
                        including procedural level generation, camera systems,
                        and player movement behaviors. Our work was submitted
                        to The Rookies, where we were awarded the Draft Selection
                        badge.

                    <br>The Unwrap Jam 2024, organized by Howest, was my first game jam
                    experience. Alongside a team of 6 other developers, we worked
                    together over 3 intense days to create a game using Unreal
                    Engine 5’s Blueprints system. It was an exciting challenge, where
                    we had to quickly prototype, iterate, and solve problems as a
                    team under tight deadlines. This experience sharpened my skills
                    in rapid game development and teamwork, giving me valuable insights
                    into the fast-paced nature of game jams.

                <p>
                    <br>I developed my own game engine in C++ and used it to
                    recreate QBert, gaining a deep understanding of key game
                    programming patterns such as the game loop, observer pattern,
                    and state pattern. Throughout the project, I also learned how to
                    effectively integrate and use libraries to enhance functionality.
                    This experience strengthened my skills in game engine architecture,
                    design patterns, and gameplay mechanics implementation.

                <p>
                    <br>I developed a dungeon generation system in C++ that creates 
                    rooms, separates them to prevent overlap, and selects larger 
                    rooms for inclusion. The rooms are connected using Delaunay 
                    triangulation and a minimum spanning tree, with hallways 
                    generated between connected rooms. Both straight and corner 
                    hallways are implemented based on room positions and spatial 
                    constraints. Through this project, I learned a lot about 
                    algorithms and how to effectively implement them to solve 
                    complex spatial problems.

                <p>
                    <br>I utilized the Vulkan API to develop multiple graphics 
                    pipelines, including 2D, 3D, and 3D instanced rendering, all 
                    implemented in C++ with CMake for project management. This 
                    involved optimizing rendering performance and working closely 
                    with low-level GPU management, giving me hands-on experience 
                    with various stages of the graphics pipeline, such as shader 
                    management and vertex processing.

                    <br>In this project, I rendered a 3D model using DirectX11, 
                    gaining a solid understanding of the DirectX graphics pipeline 
                    and its implementation with C++. This experience provided me
